## Notes

This JavaScript code dynamically imports JSON data into the website to display relevant game information. The data is loaded using standard JavaScript methods and manipulated with functions like `reduce` to calculate specific values, such as the number of unfunded games. The script then updates the DOM by appending these calculated results to designated HTML elements, ensuring that the website's content remains accurate and up-to-date based on the provided JSON data. This approach allows for easy integration and real-time updates of game statistics on the webpage.
